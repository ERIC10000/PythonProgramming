# Algorithm -> Step by step procedure of accomplishing a given task

# Simple Interest
# 1. store value of principle on variable
# 2. Store value of rate
# 3. store the value of time

# interest = (principle*rate * time)/100
# output the value of variable interest
# Generating a user input
principle = int(input("Enter the principle : "))
rate = int(input("Enter the rate : "))
time = int(input("Enter the time : "))

interest = (principle * rate * time) / 100
print("The interest is :", interest)

# 1. Using above concepts, write a code that will be prompting a user to enter amount in
# dollars then covert to Kenya Shilling



# exchange rate : 1$ = 100 kshs

# Lists, Tuples, Dictionaries, array (sets)


# 2. # Write a code to calculate the volume of a cylinder, generating the dimentions from the user
# PI * r**2 * H
