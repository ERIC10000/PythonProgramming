# Control Flow, Control Structures
# It is subdivided into 3 categories
# 1. Sequential Control Flow -> Default Flow of a program, the program execution is done line by line

# number1 = int(input("Enter the First Number: "))
# number2 = int(input("Enter the Second Number: "))
#
# result  = number1 + number2
# print("")
# print(result)


# 2. Decisional, Selection Control Flow -> Flow of the program based on condition
# if, if..else, if...elif...else, nested if
# FlowCharts

# if statements

# num = int(input("Enter the number: "))
#
# if num >= 0:
#     print(num)
#     print("The number  is greater or equal to zero")
# else:
#     print(num)
#     print("The number  is greater or equal to zero")

# Using the modulus operator %, test a number from a user whether its odd or even
# number % 2 == 0 -> Even
# Else -> Odd

number = int(input(" Enter Ypur Number : "))

if number % 2 == 0:
    print("The number is even")

else:
    print("The number is odd")
